      <h2>1. Frontend App - FileFlowUI</h2>
      <p>
        A sleek Angular application where users upload files and enter email
        information. It interacts with GoFlowGateway to initiate the file and
        email processing workflow.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Golang Application - GoFlowGateway</h2>
      <p>
        A comprehensive application that manages both file uploads and email
        distribution. It receives files and email data from FileFlowUI, manages
        records, and coordinates with RabbitMQ to process and distribute the
        data efficiently.

      <p>
        The user uploads a file and inputs email details on FileFlowUI.
        FileFlowUI sends this data to GoFlowGateway. The application then
        processes this data, managing the records and interacting with RabbitMQ.
        It oversees the file distribution to the specified email addresses and
        handles the message queue responses. The user can subsequently view the
        status of their file upload and email dispatch on FileFlowUI.
