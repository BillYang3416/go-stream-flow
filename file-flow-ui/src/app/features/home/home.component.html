      <h2>1. Frontend App - FileFlowUI</h2>
      <p>
        A sleek Angular application where users upload files and enter email
        information. It interacts with the backend to initiate the file and
        email processing workflow.
      </p>

      <h2>2. First Golang Application - GoFileGate</h2>
      <p>
        This app acts as the primary gateway for processing user uploads. It
        receives files and email data from FileFlowUI, stores the records, and
        then sends this information to a RabbitMQ broker.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Second Golang Application - GoMailDistributor</h2>
      <p>
        This application is responsible for consuming messages from the RabbitMQ
        broker. It sends the file to the specified email address and posts
        success or failure messages to another queue on the broker.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user uploads a file and inputs email details on FileFlowUI.
        FileFlowUI sends this data to GoFileGate, which records it and forwards
        it to RabbitMQ. GoMailDistributor picks up the message, processes it,
        and updates the job status on another RabbitMQ queue. GoFileGate
        receives the status update and modifies the record accordingly. The user
        is then able to see the status of their file upload and email dispatch
        on FileFlowUI.
